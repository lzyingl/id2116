   <h1>Hi! I'm Celeste</h1>
   <p>An aspiring industrial designer.</p>
   <p>With my experience thus far, I have taken a keen interest in the explorative side of design. I feel that design should be a means of communicating with others on a level that speaks to their values, perceptions and subconscious mind. To practice design in a more explorative way is to keep oneself open-minded and always in search of undiscovered possibilities. </p>
